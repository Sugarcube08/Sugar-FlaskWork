# Sugar-Flaskwork

**Sugar-Flaskwork** is a sweet and powerful microframework built on top of Flask, designed for rapid full-stack web development. It combines Flask’s flexibility with modern tools like TailwindCSS, CLI-powered automation, modular MVC architecture, and secure environment setup — all with cross-platform support.

## 🚧 Project Status: Under Development

This framework is still in its early phase and evolving rapidly. While many core features are already functional, **your contributions, ideas, and feedback are highly welcome**! If you’re passionate about Python, Flask, or developer tooling — come build with us! 💻✨

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔧 **CLI-Driven Development**  
  Built-in command-line interface using `argparse` to scaffold components like:
  - `setup` – install dependencies for Python & Node.js
  - `create:env` – generate secure `.env` with `SECRET_KEY`
  - `create:controller` – auto-generate controller files from templates
  - `runserver` – run the development server with TailwindCSS live build

- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Compatible with **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. On Windows, it uses **Scoop** to manage Node.js and TailwindCSS.

- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS Integration**  
  TailwindCSS is initialized and auto-configured during setup, and runs in `--watch` mode when the server starts.

- 🔐 **Secure .env Management**  
  Generates `.env` from a template with base64-encoded cryptographic `SECRET_KEY` using Python's `secrets`, `Fernet`, and `itsdangerous`.

- 🧱 **MVC Structure (in progress)**  
  - `controllers/` – for route logic
  - `models/` – for database models
  - `templates/` – for HTML views
  *(Auto-generation for model and template files is in active development)*

- 📦 **Automated Setup Script**  
  The `setup` command installs all Python and Node dependencies, initializes Tailwind, and prepares the environment.

# 🔧 Install all required dependencies (Python & Node)
